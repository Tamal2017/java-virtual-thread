## Simple demo app to test Java virtual thread with Spring
### There are two small app; 
- The first one is _vt-blocker_ a blocking spring web using Thread.sleep();
- The second is _vt-main_ the entering point of our testm, calling the _vt-blocker_ blocking app by using RestTemplate.-

We will use application.properties to configure the main app enabled virtual thread or linite le number of thread within the Tomcar server (refer to line 4 and 7 ). You can comment or uncomment the config you want to test
Use the end point _http://localhost:8080/block/3_ (where 3 is the number of second you want to block a request) of main app to run the test.
You can use Apache Benmark to run many resquests in parall. For Windows user refer to this website [apachelounge](https://www.apachelounge.com/download/#google_vignette) to download a zip version for Windos.
